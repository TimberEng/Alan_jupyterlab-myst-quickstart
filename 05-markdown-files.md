With the JupyterLab MyST extension, you can also open and preview a markdown file as you are working on it. This will open up in real time and show you the updates! ðŸŽ‰

The markdown document can use any of the same roles and directives from MyST with hover-previews. Any document, including notebooks, can be exported to a PDF document.
